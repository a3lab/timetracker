Time tracker device for work hours worked at a given location. 

Code written by: Matthew Loewen


This project is a Raspberry Pi 3 connected to a RFID-RC522 chip for reading rfid cards
and displaying messages on a LCD display (2x16).Indented use is for users to come to work
scan their tag and then select what they will be working on the day. This in hopes of 
tracking how many work hours go into what projects. User hours will be saved to a SQL
database run by PHP scripts. Eventually a website will be created to display meaningful
information about the recorded information. When users leave for the day it is to be 
expected that will scan out.
